# Antrace
This is a simple and Anttastic game that most likely will bore you to death if played for longer than 2 minutes. 

The purpose of the project is to show a good and clean game structure, using my own custom timers and events modules.
It should be fairly easy to reuse this as a base for your own game(s).

Enjoy!
