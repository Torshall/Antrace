# Antrace
This is a simple and Anttastic game that most likely will bore you to death if played for longer than 2 minutes. 

The purpose of the project is to show a good and clean game structure, using my own custom timers and events modules.

Should be fairly easy to clean up and reuse for your own game.

Enjoy!
